The structured sense of mathematical language, as well as many its semantic properties, makes general text retrieval models (e.g. “bag of words” model) deficient to provide good search result. 

In this paper, we have addressed the problems of measuring the similarity degree between mathematical formulae and proposed an approach to parse mathematical content (particularly in \LaTeX \ markup) into a tree representation, index syntactic information from math formulae, and a search method to capture some level of query-document subgraph isomorphism, combined with a pruning method to speed search. 
We build our own proof-of-concept prototype search engine to demonstrate the ideas mentioned in this paper, and thus are able to present some evaluation results. 
Through this paper, we have showed another possibility to tackle a number of the problems in math-aware search.
