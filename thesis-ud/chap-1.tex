\chapter{Background}
Apart from general text content, structured information is also widely contained by digital document. Among these, a lot of mathematical content (including documents on Internet), are represented using markups like \LaTeX\  or MathML~\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/Math/}}, which is in a rich structural way. 
Information Retrieval on those structured data in mathematics language is not that well-studied or exhaustively covered by mainstream IR research, compared to that with general text. 
Thus it can be challenging yet very helpful given the contribution and importance of mathematics to our science. 

However, the structured sense of mathematical language, as well as many its semantic properties (see section~\ref{measure_sim}), makes general text retrieval models deficient to provide good search results. Through this paper, we have made our efforts to tackle some of these problems. 
Some of the ideas used in this paper deals with "tree structured" data in a general way, have the potential to be applied by other fields of structured data retrieval besides that from mathematical language. 

\section{Math IR Topics}

Mathematical information involves a wide spectrum of topics, 
we are, of cause, not focusing on every aspects in mathematical information retrieval. 
It is good to clarify our concentration in this paper here, by first listing a set of concentrations that a mathematical information retrieval topics may be classified into,
and define our target field of study.

\pagebreak
Listed here, are considered four possible concentrations of topic for mathematical information retrieval:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Boolean or Similarity Search
\item Math Detection and Recognition
\item Evaluation, Derivation and Calculation
\item Other topics 
\end{enumerate}

The first one is doing mathematical information retrieval by searching, and finding the most relevant context of document that matches the query, very similar to the most common ways that other general text search engines will do, by boolean or similarity search~\cite{iir}. 
The only difference is, the query may contain mathematical expressions. 
Instance of such search engine can be useful in many ways, for example, student may utilize it to know which identity can be applied to a formulae in order to give a proof of that formulae.
This is the area where we focus in this paper. Specifically, we are proposing a series of methods for similarity search of math content. And our method is using query only in \LaTeX\ markup 
(some math-aware search engines~\footnote{WolframAlpha: \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/} and Zentralblatt math \\from MathWebSearch: \url{http://search.mathweb.org/zbl/}} support queries in mathematical formulae and normal text together), and return documents ordered by score which indicates the similarity degree. 

Digital mathematical content document can also be in an image format (e.g. generated by a handwritten query), thus to retrieve these information involves detection or recognition. Inspired by the advances from deep learning, we may foresee a large potential to be explored on topics related to this. 

Because the nature of mathematical language, a query (e.g. an algebra expression) can be evaluated and potentially derived into an alternate form, or calculated. 
The result value of evaluation or derived form may also be considered being relevant to that query. 
These potentially require a system to handle symbolic or value calculation, or even a good knowledge of derivation rules implied by different mathematical expression
(e.g. computational engine \textit{Symbolab}~\footnote{Symbolab Web Search: \url{http://www.symbolab.com}}).

Besides the first three concentrations, there are many other topics. Knowledge mining, for example, will need deeper level of understanding on math content. A typical goal of this topic is to give a solution or answer based on information retrieved from math content. e.g. ``Find an article related to the \textit{Four Color Theorem}"~\cite{ntcirtopic}.

These concentrations somehow overlap in some cases, for example, some derivation can be used to better assess the similarity between math formulae, e.g. $\dfrac{a + b}{c}$ and $\dfrac{a}{c} + \dfrac{b}{c}$ should be considered as relevant.
Therefore even boolean or similarity search possibly involves certain level of understanding of mathematics. In terms of similarity, however, we only address the measurement for structural and symbol differences in this paper, without considering further topics lured from measuring math content similarity, such as evaluation or derivation.

\section{Issues in Measuring Similarity}
\label{measure_sim}
Different from general text, there are a number of new problems in measuring mathematical expression similarity. 
Among these, we select and focus on those regarding to structural similarity and symbolic differences between expressions. 
At the same time trying to respect the semantical information inferred from structure or symbols in mathematical expressions.
But even without caring about the possible derivations and high level knowledge inference, there are still many new problems.

Firstly, differences of symbols, structure and possible semantic rules in mathematics should be captured, and not one by one, but in an cooperative manner to measure similarity. 
To illustrate this point, we know that only respecting symbolic information is of course not sufficient in mathematical language. e.g. $ax+(b+c)$ in most cases is not equivalent to $(a+b)x+c$ (although they have the same set of symbols).
And the order of tokens in math expression can be commutative in some cases but not always. For example, commutative property in math makes $a+b=b+c$ for addition operation, but on the other hand $\dfrac a b$ is most likely not equivalent to $\dfrac b a$.
These make many general text search methods (e.g. \textit{bag of words} model, \textit{tf-idf} weighting) inadequate. 
Moreover, symbols can be used interchangeably to represent the same meaning, e.g. $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $x^2+y^2=z^2$. 
However, interchangeability comes with some constrains to maintain the same semantical meaning, that is, changes of symbols in expression preserve more syntactic similarity when changes are made by substitution. e.g. For query $x(1+x)$, expression $a(1+a)$ are considered more relevant than $a(1+b)$. 

Secondly, trying to capture semantic information from expressions will help measure similarity but introduce ambiguity. 
Apart from the cases covered in \cite{parsing_tex}, semantic incorrect written markups, which is somehow common in many online documents, e.g. writing ``sin" in \LaTeX\ markup instead of macro ``\textbackslash sin", will make it difficult to tell whether it is a product of three symbols or a \textit{sine} function, thus need to disambiguate. 
And depending on what level of semantical meaning we want to capture, ambiguity cases can be different. 
Consider $f(2x+1)$, if we want to know if $f$ is a function rather than a variable, the only possibility is looking for implicit contexts, but we can nevertheless always think of it as a product without losing the possibility to search similar expression like $f(1 + 2y)$, the same way goes reciprocal $a^{-1}$ and inverse function $f^{-1}$. 
Most often, even if no semantic ambiguity occurs, efforts are needed to capture some semantical meanings. e.g. In $\displaystyle\int f(x) \dfrac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sin x}$ and $\sin 2 \pi$, it is not easy to figure out, without a little knowledge on integral or trigonometric function, that integral is applied to $\dfrac {f(x)} {\sin x}$ and the scope applied by sine function is $2 \pi$.

Search systems play an essential role in our daily lives because there are
a huge number of pages on the Web. However, we sometimes encounter
problems with how to search for or what to submit as a query when we
want to search for things that cannot be easily expressed in natural language.

notational ambiguities, and syntactical and semantic equivalences, make math
knowledge harder to search.


As computers appeared, one of the important tasks that emerged was
storing and searching large sets of documents. The inverted index was an
early and natural development in this field. It can be thought of like an index
in a book: it is a structure that maps each term to a list of documents that
contains it. In its most simple form, an inverted index only allows us to find
the documents that contain a given term

More and more math knowledge has become available on the Web, and search
is a gate to such vast treasure of digital mathematics content [11]. Even though

MathML vs LaTeX

First,
one mathematical formula may use different notations and
thus has different representations. 1 Second, two semanti-
cally different mathematical document can contain the same
number of terms. 2 Also, the order of terms in math language
sometimes matters but can be mutable in other cases, which
implies it is impractical to uniformly apply one single lan-
guage model to mathematical content.

\section{Related Work}

An inverted index is the tool used most commonly in text search. It is
a lookup table from words to the documents that contain them. This idea has
been modified to allow for word locality, phrase searching, index compression,
and distributed indexing. With these and other improvements, systems can
be built to quickly search massive
